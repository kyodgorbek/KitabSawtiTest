# KitabSawtiTest
Developed CV Android App for KitabSawti

This Project purely written in Java
If you want to use it first you have to run app and install it in your device. After installation you have to press tabs on the bottom and it will load
 Bottom navigation Tabs consist of five items such as Overview, Education, Work, Skills and Contact.I have used Realm Database for Data Persistance and 
 implemented in Overview Tab. For Image downloading I used Image Downloading Libraries such as  Gradle and Picasso.
